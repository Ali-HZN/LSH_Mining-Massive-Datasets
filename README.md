# Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)

### General Idea:
<div align="justify"><b>LSH</b> refers to a family of functions (known as LSH families) to hash data points into buckets so that data points near each other are located in the same buckets with high probability, while data points far from each other are likely to be in different buckets. This makes it easier to identify observations with various degrees of similarity.</div>
